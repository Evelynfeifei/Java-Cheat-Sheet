# Java-Cheat-Sheet
I built this cheat sheet for an entry level Java interview.  I built it to the standards of my job description. 
Therefore it its important to review your job descripiton for the role your applying for and then use mine, or 
alter it depending on your needs.  Feel free to fork it to make adjustments to fit your needs.  Perhaps I'll make
more Cheat Sheets in the future for other languages if I find the time!  

There is a .md verison of the cheat sheet, as well as a PDF and .docx verison!  However the word version would be 
the best version to start with becuase you can adjust it to your needs!  Enjoy!
